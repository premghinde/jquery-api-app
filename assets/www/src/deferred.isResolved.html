    <p>This API is <code>deprecated</code> as of jQuery 1.7 and <code>removed</code> as of jQuery 1.8; please use <code>deferred.state()</code> instead.</p>
    <p>Returns <code>true</code> if the Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <code>deferred.resolve()</code> or <code>deferred.resolveWith()</code> has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).</p>
    <p>Note that a Deferred object can be in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected; use <code>deferred.isRejected()</code> to determine whether the Deferred object is in the rejected state. These methods are primarily useful for debugging, for example to determine whether a Deferred has already been resolved even though you are inside code that intended to reject it.</p>
