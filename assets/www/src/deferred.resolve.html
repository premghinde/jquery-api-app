    <p>When the Deferred is resolved, any doneCallbacks added by <code>deferred.then</code> or <code>deferred.done</code> are called. Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Each callback is passed the <code>args</code> from the <code>.resolve()</code>. Any doneCallbacks added after the Deferred enters the resolved state are executed immediately when they are added, using the arguments that were passed to the <code>.resolve()</code> call. For more information, see the documentation for Deferred object.</p>
