    <p>The deferred.state() method returns a string representing the current state of the Deferred object. The Deferred object can be in one of three states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>"pending"</strong>: The Deferred object is not yet in a completed state (neither "rejected" nor "resolved").</li>
      <li>
<strong>"resolved"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <code>deferred.resolve()</code> or <code>deferred.resolveWith()</code> has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called). </li>
      <li>
<strong>"rejected"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the rejected state, meaning that either <code>deferred.reject()</code> or <code>deferred.rejectWith()</code> has been called for the object and the failCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This method is primarily useful for debugging to determine, for example, whether a Deferred has already been resolved even though you are inside code that intended to reject it.</p>
