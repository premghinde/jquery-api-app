    <p>Normally, only the creator of a Deferred should call this method; you can prevent other code from changing the Deferred's state by returning a restricted Promise object through <code>deferred.promise()</code>.</p>
    <p>When the Deferred is rejected, any failCallbacks added by <code>deferred.then</code> or <code>deferred.fail</code> are called. Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Each callback is passed the <code>args</code> from the <code>deferred.reject()</code> call. Any failCallbacks added after the Deferred enters the rejected state are executed immediately when they are added, using the arguments that were passed to the <code>.reject()</code> call. For more information, see the documentation for Deferred object.</p>
